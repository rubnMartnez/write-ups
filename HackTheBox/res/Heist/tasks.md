--- post ---------------------

- check history-
- check network info-
- check folders (downloads, desktop, find something istalled)
  - where could be the iis website stored
  - where could be the router config stored
- check cisco config for missconfigs
- run winpeas-
  - check groups and users-


--------------------------------------

- find chase email
- move to hazard (or other user) and try to access IIS files

---------------------------------------------

if chase has to check the issues and the router config, he has to have access to the iis where those are, though on CLI he hasn't
 - so either we find his email and access it through web (hopefully there's some useful info there)
 - or we move to hazard (since he should have acces there to get the files, that's why they've created the account on the first place) user or someone else and access iis from there
